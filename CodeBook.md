Except subject and activity variables the rest variables represents a feature that was extracted from the raw data sets. The follows apply to all faetures:
1. Every feature begins either with the letter "t" or "f" indicating that
   the feature were derived in time or frequency.
2. Features that come from the accellerometer, gyroscope, body, gravity are
   denoted by "acc", "gyro", "body" or "bodybody" and "gravity" respectivelly.
3. Signals were obtained from body linear acceleration and angular velocity
   denoted by jerk signals were obtained from body linear acceleration and
   angular velocity.

4. Letters "x", "y", "z" at the end of each variable indicate the direction of the
   three-axial raw signal.
5. The "mean" and the "std" in a feature, represent that the feuture represents
   the corresponding mean or standard deviation
6. Values of all features is [-1,1]
